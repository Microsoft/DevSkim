## Contributing Issues

### Before Submitting an Issue

First, please do a search of [open issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/DevSkim/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your
[reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment.

üëç - upvote

üëé - downvote

If your issue is a question then please ask the question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/devskim)
using the tag `devskim`.

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, submit an issue using the guidelines below.

## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request.

* Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
* Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.
* Turning on `debug` mode can be helpful in providing more information (Package Settings | DevSkim | Settings - User | set `"debug": true`)

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix. Therefore:

* Provide reproducible steps, what the result of the steps was, and what you would have expected.
* A description of what you expect to happen
* Code that demonstrates the issue, when providing a code snippet also include it in source and not only as an image
* Version of DevSkim and Sublime Text
* Errors in the Sublime Text Console (View | Show Console)

Don't feel bad if we can't reproduce the issue and ask for more information!
